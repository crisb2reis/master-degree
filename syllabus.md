# **Syllabus:** Uncertainties and Impacts of Precipitation on Coastal Hightways.

## **Possible advisor:** Nandamudi Lankalapalli Vijaykumar

## **Problem Statement:** 
  
    How the integration of different variables correlated to precipitation in spatial modeling, would reduce uncertainty about the distribution of rainfall, which has an impact on the blocking of stretches of mountain ranges on coastal roads, which comes from the complex geoecological relationships of the area and its sparse coverage of data.
