# **Syllabus:** Uncertainties and Impacts of Precipitation on Coastal Hightways.

## **Possible advisor:** Nandamudi Lankalapalli Vijaykumar

## **Problem Statement:** 
  
  How the integration of different variables correlated to precipitation in spatial modeling, would reduce uncertainty about the distribution of rainfall, which has an impact on the blocking of stretches of mountain ranges on coastal roads, which comes from the complex geoecological relationships of the area and its sparse coverage of data.
   
   <li>The main objective is to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution os extreme precipitation events, whitch cause significant impacts on the blocking of the Tamoios Highway mountain range, producing information that can contribute to reducing the uncertainty associated with the phenomenon. Based on this information, propose methodologies that incorporate uncertainties and assist inplanning actions aimed at minimizing and preventing impacts.</li>
   
   <li>To investigate the temporal patterns of precipitation for the sectors of Serra do Mar paulista, mainly in the region of Caraguatatuba, through the analysis of historicol series of the pluviometric data of the area, in the scales of annual and daily analysis; Survey and analyze occurrences of impacts caused by heavy rains;</li>
   
   <li>Simulate scenarios of the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation events, relating them to highty correlated geoecological attributes (altimetry, slope and alope exposure), seeking to investigate exixting uncertainties, in order to point out areas with greater;lesser probability of occurrence of the above events the established limit and present maps that allow the visualization of the variability.</li>
   
   <li>Propose impact prediction models for the area, considering its own susceptibility and vulnerability characteristics.</li>
